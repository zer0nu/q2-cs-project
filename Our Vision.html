        <h4>
            So what's Our Vision?
        </h4>
        <p>
            We want to create our app, GetHelp. This app could be thought of as a social media
            but aimed specifically for mental health issues. Not only will we have consultation
            with other people, but with trained profressionals that we will hire.<br><br>

            The App will have the following:
        </p>
            
        <h4>
            Personal Chats to Our Therapists
        </h4>
        <p>
            This will be the main focus of our app, <b>connecting users and our professionals</b>
            easier than ever. We plan not to just limit our app to messaging, but we could also
            have voicechats or videochats that could be paid (if the therapist wishes so). This
            accessibility to trained therapists is something we think is groundbreaking, because
            with just the touch of a finger, we could be reducing depression and suicide cases by huge numbers.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Group Chats with other users
        </h4>
        <p>
            We will also have group chats like other social media apps, this is to really help meet people
            with the same problems as you and of course make friends on our platform. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Algorithm for meeting with new people
        </h4>
        <p>
            Lastly, we plan to have an "Omegle" kind of meeting system, where people can input
            the kind of problems or experiences they might be going through, and be matched up
            people of a similar demographic through our AI to talk and help each other get through
            similar tought times. You can of course friend these people and talk even more or add them
            to groupchats.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>
            Our Predicted Benefits
        </h4>
        <p>
            We want to build a world where we can finally normalize the fact that mental health
            is an issue to be taken with serious demeanor. We believe that with our app we can not 
            only help a huge demographic of people but make them happier in life, not to mention 
            meeting a few friends along the way. Laslty, we predict that if we are successful enough
            with our launch, we could live in a world where as a therapist or doctor, it is normal
            to have a GetHelp account where people can consult you which could help you in building
            a career from our simple app.
