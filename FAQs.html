        <h4>Q: SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS, AN ADVOCACY? OR SOMETHING ELSE?</h4>
        <p>We Identify as a Start Up. We Created this website to start advertising and trying
            to get sponsors for our app idea which we need to make money for (for paying
            profressionals and developing). However we don't think that we necessarily need to
            limit this website to a start up. This <b>could</b> be an advocacy that you can
            share if you support our ideas and think that Mental Health is something we really
            need to focus on.
        </p>
        <h4>Q: WHAT ARE YOU PLANS FOR YOUR APP?</h4>
        <p>
            We want our app to become the first online and fully functioning therapeutic app.
            We want to make a solid online community that is open to many joining for consultation
            on mental health issues, something like a subreddit community, where you can meet and
            talk with other people, but an added benefit of our app is tring to make real <b>profresional
            therapists </b> build their careers <b>online</b>, where they can be consulted through personal chat. We
            think that this will benefit both the users and the therapists. You can see more about 
            Our Vision <a href = "Our Vision.html">here.</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Q: WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO MAKE GET HELP?</h4>
        <p>
            Making GetHelp was inspired by the daily hardships that we have went through. All of
            us are students in Philippine Science High School (Pisay), an undoubtedly hard 
            school. We were inspired to help all the people surrounding us because of the many difficulties,
            whether it be because of school, family, friends, we believed that everyone had the right
            to <b>Get Help</b>, thus the name of our App. You can see more about us <a href = "About Us.html">here.</a>
        </p>
        <h4>Q: WHY CHOOSE ICT INSTEAD OF PHYSICAL INTERACTION?</h4>
        <p>
            We admit that presently, physically going to therapy and getting help may be more effective,
            however a big advantage of ICT is that is greatly more accessible. Going to therapy
            is expensive, not to mention that as a teen, mental health is not taken as seriously
            and parents may not be willing to invest in visiting a profressional even though their 
            child may really need it. We believe that if we are to make an online solution that works
            just as well as physically going to therapy, we will be able to reduce suicide cases around 
            the entire world by a large percentage.
